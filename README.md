everytrail4net
==============

everytrail4net is a simple C# wrapper around the existing functionality of the EveryTrail (www.everytrail.com) API. 

The library in its current state is intended for C#.NET developers who would 
like a jumpstart to writing applications specifically against the EveryTrail API.

It is a work in a progress, so PLEASE do not hesitate to contact me with bugs, feature requests, etc...
